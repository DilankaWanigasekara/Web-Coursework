	<h2>About the Game</h2>
		<p>
		Basketball is played by two teams of five players each. The object of the game is to score more
		points than your opponent. 
		<br><br>
		<b>Basketball – Objective</b><br>
		The main objective of basketball is to make a goal and score points. A goal is made by
		shooting the ball through the basket or hoop. The goal post or basket for a team is in the
		opponent’s court. Each team should not only try to make a goal and prevent the
		opposite team from taking control of the ball, but should also try to protect the basket in
		their court and prevent the opponent from making a goal.
		<br><br>
		<b>Basketball – Team Size</b><br>
		Each team may have twelve players entitled to play the game. Five players from a team
		can play at any time in the court and they may be substituted at anytime during the
		play. Each team may have a coach and an assistant coach. Each team may have a group
		of less than five non-players with different responsibilities. They are usually manager,
		doctor, physiotherapist, statistician, and interpreter. 
		<br><br>
		<b>Participating Countries</b><br>
		As basketball originated in the United States, it is very popular in the country and has
		spread to other surrounding countries. NBA should be credited for expanding the game
		and creating a huge fan base throughout the world.
		China dominates Asian Basketball Championships and has won many titles. Basketball is
		the most popular sport in Philippines. Iran, South Korea and Japan are also good
		competitors to China in FIBA Asia Championships. Russia defeated United States at 1972
		Summer Olympics and caught the world’s attention.
		Some of the countries that produced basketball champions are: Greece, Lithuania,
		Serbia, Spain, France, Canada, USA, Brazil, Italy, Argentina, and Montenegro<br><br><br>

	<h2>History of the Game</h2>
	<p>
		<b><u>Who Invented Basketball?</u></b>
		<ul>
		<li>Basketball was invented in December 1891 by the Canadian clergyman, educator, and physician James Naismith. Naismith introduced the game when he was an instructor at the Young Men's Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts. At the request of his superior, Dr. Luther H. Gulick, he organized a vigorous recreation suitable for indoor winter play. The game involved elements of American football, soccer, and hockey, and the first ball used was a soccer ball. Teams had nine players, and the goals were wooden peach baskets affixed to the walls. By 1897-1898, teams of five became standard. The game rapidly spread nationwide and to Canada and other parts of the world, played by both women and men; it also became a popular informal outdoor game. U.S. servicemen in World War II (1939-1945) popularized the sport in many other countries.</li><br>

		<li>A number of U.S. colleges adopted the game between about 1893 and 1895. In 1934 the first college games were staged in New York City's Madison Square Garden, and college basketball began to attract heightened interest. By the 1950s basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball.</li><br>


		<li>The first pro league, the National Basketball League, was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game. This league only lasted five years before disbanding; its demise spawned a number of loosely organized leagues throughout the northeastern United States. One of the first and greatest pro teams was the Original Celtics, organized about 1915 in New York City. They played as many as 150 games a season and dominated basketball until 1936. The Harlem Globetrotters, founded in 1927, a notable exhibition team, specializes in amusing court antics and expert ball handling.</li><br>


		<li>In 1949 two subsequent professional leagues, the National Basketball League (formed in 1937) and the Basketball Association of America (1946) merged to create the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Boston Celtics, led by their center Bill Russell, dominated the NBA from the late 1950s through the 1960s. By the 1960s, pro teams from coast to coast played before crowds of many millions annually. Wilt Chamberlain, a center for the Los Angeles Lakers, was another leading player during the era, and his battles with Russell were eagerly anticipated. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, also a center, came to prominence during the 1970s. Jabbar perfected his famed "sky hook" shot while playing for the Los Angeles Lakers and dominated the opposition.
		</li><br>


		<li>The game he ended up inventing is the game we all know and love today – basketball.  </li><br>

	<span id="Rules">
	<h2>Rules and Regulations</h2>
			<p><ol>
		<li>In a standard basketball game, 2 teams of maximum 12 players are allowed. A maximum of 5 players of each team on the court at any time is allowed.</li>
		<li>The teams are permitted to make as many substitutions as they wish.</li><br>

		<b><u>Duration</u></b>
		<li>The game includes four periods of 10 minutes each.</li>
		<li>If the score gets tied,  an overtime period of 5 minutes is played until one team has more points than the other one (at the end of the 5-minute period)</li><br>

		<b><u>Scoring</u></b>
		<li>If a basket is scored from near the basket i.e. inside the three-point arc, it is worth 2 points.</li>
		<li>If a basket is scored from far away i.e. beyond the three-point arc, it is worth 3 points.</li>
		<li>If a basket scored from the free-throw line, it is worth 1 point.</li><br>
		
		<b><u>Moving the ball</u></b>
		<li>The ball may either be passed from one player to another or dribbled by a player from one point to another, albeit it has to be bounced while walking or running.</li>
		<li>A player may take two steps without dribbling, before passing or shooting the ball.
		Once if a player stops dribbling, he cannot start to dribble again.</li>
		<li>If the team with the ball-possession has passed across the half-court line, it cannot cross back over the line with the ball.</li><br>
		
		<b><u>Shot clock</u></b>
		<li>If a team gains ball-possession, they have up to 24 seconds to attempt a shot.</li>
		<li>In addition to this, the offensive players cannot remain within the restricted area for more than 3 consecutive seconds.</li><br>

		<b><u>Fouls</u></b>
		<li>A personal foul occurs if there is any kind of illegal physical contact between two opponents. A player with more than 5 personal fouls is excluded from the game.</li>
		<li>A foul made on a player who is attempting to take a shot results in the awarding of the same number of free-throws as those of the shot taken (i.e. 2 from inside the arc, 3 from outside).</li>
		<li>If the player who is being fouled upon makes the attempted shot, the shot is counted and an additional free-throw is awarded.</li>
		<li>If a team makes 4 fouls in a single period, each additional foul (on a player not attempting a shot) thereafter results in an automatic awarding of 2 free-throws.</li>

	<h2>How to Play</h2>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>The ball is tossed in the air to start the game. One of the players deflects it to a
		teammate. It is dribbled and passed among the teammates to protect the ball and to
		make a goal. </li><br>

		<li>The basket or the hoop is placed horizontally at the height of 10 feet on a
		back board. Each team tries to protect the goal on their side while trying to make a goal
		on the opponent’s side of the court.</li><br>

		<li>The opposite team tries to get the ball, take control of it while bouncing and tries to grab
		it while it is passed among the team mates to prevent a goal. When a player commits a
		foul, the other team gets a chance of free throw or to inbound the ball. </li><br>

		<li>Each goal carries
		two points and each free throw one point. The team with higher score wins the game.
		Players may be substituted when a substitute asks for it</li><br>


		<li>The game starts when the referee throws a jump ball. In the international sport, each
		game is divided into four 10 minute periods. However, if there’s a tie between the teams
		they play for an extra period of 5 minutes.</li><br>


		<li>After the first period and after the third period, the players take a 2 minute break. After
		the second period the players take a 15 minute break and exchange baskets. After a
		break, the last player holding the ball throws the ball in and starts the next period.</li><br>


		<li>The play time may also be increased if a foul is committed just before the time ticks off.
		In such cases a free throw is granted despite the time lapse.If a player throws the ball before the time lapses, but the ball flies down the basket after
		the timer ticks off, the goal is still considered.
		</li><br>
