	<h1>What is Swimming?</h2>
	<p>
	Swimming is the sport or activity of propelling oneself through water using the limbs.

	Swimming can be both an individual or team sport. 

	There are a number of different Swimming styles including breaststroke, freestyle, backstroke and butterfly.
	
	
	
	Swimming is for everyone no matter what age or level of fitness. Any age can learn to swim and there is no age limit on when you can no
	longer swim. Swimming is a life long skill that could save your or another’s life.  It is never too late to learn to swim. Swimming is an
	excellent way to keep fit and most swimming pools cater for all. Woman only, parent and toddler, senior classes amongst others.

	A swimming costume is all you need to get started. You can also ware swimming tops or close fitting t-shirts until you feel more comfortable.
	We would also suggest goggles to protect eyes.

	Most swimming pools have classes for all levels of ability, from adult only to toddler beginner’s lessons. Time tables and your local pools are 
	available on our website.</p>
	
	
	
	
	<h1>Here Are 8 Different Swimming Styles and Strokes:</h1>
	<h2>Freestyle/Front Crawl</h2>
	<img class= "im" src="freestyle.jpg">
	<p>The front crawl is likely the first swimming stroke you think of when you picture swimming. It is commonly called the freestyle stroke as most
	swimmers choose to use this stroke in freestyle events as it is the fastest.

	To execute the front crawl, you lie on your stomach with your body parallel to the water. Propel yourself forward with alternating arm movements in a 
	sort of windmill motion that starts by pushing underwater and recovers above water. Your legs should propel you with a flutter kick, which is performed
	with pointed feet as your legs move up and down in alternation. Do not bend your legs at the knee.</p>
	<h2>breast Strokes</h2>
	<img class= "im" src="beststrokes.jpg">
	<p>The breaststroke is the slowest competitive swimming stroke, and it is the most commonly learned stroke. It’s often taught to beginner swimmers because
	it
	does not require putting your head underwater. However, in competitive swimming, swimmers do submerge their head and breathe at designated points in the 
	stroke.

	This stroke is performed with your stomach facing down. Your arms move simultaneously beneath the surface of the water in a half circular movement
	in front of
	your body. Your legs perform the whip kick at the same time. The whip kick is executed by bringing your legs from straight behind you close to your
	body by bending
	both at your knees and at your hips. 
	Your legs then move outward and off to the side before extending and coming back together. This swimming technique is often compared to a frog’s 
	movement.</p>
	<h2>Backstroke</h2>
	<img class= "im" src="backstroke.jpg">
	<p>The backstroke requires similar movements to the front crawl, but it is done, as the name suggests, on your back. Doctors often recommend this
	stroke 
	to individuals with back problems as it provides a great back workout.

	To perform the backstroke, while floating on your back, alternate your arms with a windmill-like motion to propel yourself backwards. Like the front
	crawl, your
	arms should start the circular motion by pushing underwater and recovering above water. Your legs should engage in a flutter kick. Your face should
	be above the
	surface as you look straight up.</p>
	<h2>Butterfly</h2>
	<img class= "im" src="ki.jpg">
	<p>The butterfly is an advanced swimming stroke that provides an excellent workout. It can be more difficult and tiring to learn, but it is also a 
	lot of fun. It 
	is the second fastest competitive stroke, and the favorite stroke of Olympic legend Michael Phelps.

	To perform the butterfly stroke, start horizontal with your stomach facing the bottom of the pool. Bring your arms simultaneously over your head and
	push them into
	the water to propel you forward and bring them up out of the water again to repeat. As you move your arms into the water, you will push your head
	and shoulders above
	the surface of the water.</p>
	
	<p>
	Your legs will perform a dolphin kick, which requires your legs to stay together and straight as you kick them similarly to how a dolphin’s lower
	body and tail moves.
	Move your body in a fluid wave-like motion.

	Keep your body as straight as possible, with a slight decline in the lower body to keep your legs underwater. Don’t allow your hips to get too low
	or your body to bend 
	too much or it will slow you down. Keep your legs close together and use the motion from your hips to get a more powerful kick.</P>
